## Introduction

Hello! My name is [Your Name] and this project is a school project aimed at fulfilling the requirements for grades and a presentation. In this project, we explore the concept of class imbalance in datasets and its impact on machine learning models. We specifically focus on comparing the performance of models trained on imbalanced data versus balanced data obtained through oversampling techniques.

## Installation

run !pip install [Package_name]

## Usage
The primary usage of this project is for comparing the performance of machine learning models on imbalanced and balanced datasets after oversampling. Here are the steps to use this project:

Sampling the Dataset: Explore various techniques for sampling the dataset to address class imbalance.
Training Models: Train machine learning models, such as Random Forest, on both imbalanced and balanced datasets.
Performance Comparison: Compare the performance metrics (e.g., accuracy, precision, recall) of models trained on imbalanced and balanced datasets to assess the impact of oversampling.

## Features
List the key features of your project. Describe what your project can do or the problems it can solve.

Sampling the Dataset: Implement various techniques for addressing class imbalance, such as oversampling.
Random Forest: Utilize the Random Forest algorithm for classification tasks.
Hyperparameter Tuning: Explore techniques for optimizing model performance through hyperparameter tuning.
